        <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>A New High-Stakes Way to Bet on Sports</strong></h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Use promo code TQE and get two risk-free bets up to $1,000!</strong></p>
        <p>What makes the Australian company PointsBet so exciting is that they are bringing a whole new product to the online sports betting market. The high-risk, high-reward sportsbook adds more intrigue and excitement than other websites or apps where you can place an online sports wager in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>When you are using “points betting,” every point matters. For example, if you take the Patriots -7 and win on a standard NFL bet you would double your money. But in points betting for every point the Patriots score above 7 to win the game, you win your wager amount. However, there is also a downside because every point the Patriots win by that is less than 7 (or if they lose) you lose your wager amount. You can set caps to mitigate risk, but every point is critical in points betting.</p>
