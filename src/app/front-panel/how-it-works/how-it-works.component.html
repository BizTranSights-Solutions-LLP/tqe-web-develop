    <p>The Quant Edge provides you an edge in sports betting and fantasy by bringing the best of mathematics,
      statistics, and machine learning to help you win.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Here is how we do it:</p>

    <h5>1. We use a machine learning approach.</h5>
    <p>How does machine learning work? We add tons of information into an algorithm - including injuries, player
      matchups, historical performance and many others. Our algorithm identifies and prioritizes the most relevant
      inputs for each game to provide recommendations on the optimal strategies to win money. We accomplish this with
      former finance hedge fund managers who have used these techniques for decades, as well as PhDs with quantitative
      backgrounds who are deep experts on the cutting edge of machine learning.</p>
    <br />

    <h5>2. We never stop learning and innovating to maximize returns.</h5>
    <p>We are constantly learning and tweaking our models based on the latest results to preserve the excellence of our
      record and to maximize value for you, our subscribers.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>3. Just like in the financial markets, winning requires diversification.</h5>
    <p> In order to make the most of The Quant Edge, it's important to place multiple bets across multiple sports over
      multiple months. We have won 275 of the 489 high confidence bets since the middle of the 2018-2019 seasons. This
      Equates to making $6,710 from placing just $100 on each high confidence opportunity pointed out by TQE over the
      past 5 years, from 2018-2019 season through 2022-2023 season.</p>
    <br />
    <h5>4. Betting with The Quant Edge</h5>
    <p>By placing bets across our opportunities, you can hypothetically win real money in a matter of weeks. Below you
      can see the returns based on different Implied Win Probability rates, for Favourite and Underdog. </p>
