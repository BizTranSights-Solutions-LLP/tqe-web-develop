          <p>DraftKings was the industry standard in DFS, and it gave them a head start in online sports betting from which they have never looked back. DK leaves little to be desired with its user-friendly interface, many options, and promotions — all designed to make it the best sportsbook in the legal sports gambling industry. If you could sign up with only one Sportsbook, we would recommend DraftKings.</p>
