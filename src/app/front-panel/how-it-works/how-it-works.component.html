        <p>The Quant Edge provides you an edge in sports betting and fantasy by bringing the best of mathematics, statistics, and machine learning to help you win.
        <p>Here is how we do it:</p>

        <h2>1. We use a machine learning approach.</h2>
        <p>How does machine learning work? We add tons of information into an algorithm - including injuries, player matchups, historical performance and many others. Our algorithm identifies and prioritizes the most relevant inputs for each game to provide recommendations on the optimal strategies to win money. We accomplish this with former finance hedge fund managers who have used these techniques for decades, as well as PhDs with quantitative backgrounds who are deep experts on the cutting edge of machine learning.</p>

        <h2>2. We never stop learning and innovating to maximize returns.</h2>
        <p>We are constantly learning and tweaking our models based on the latest results to preserve the excellence of our record and to maximize value for you, our subscribers.</p>

        <h2>3. Just like in the financial markets, winning requires diversification.</h2>
        <p>In order to make the most of The Quant Edge, it’s important to place multiple bets across multiple sports over multiple months. We win roughly 60% of our bets -- which is among the best in the industry – but, of course , we will be wrong approximately 40% of the time. It’s therefore very important that you allocate your bets across all of our recommended opportunities instead of picking just one or two of them.</p>

        <h2>4. Betting with The Quant Edge can win you real money.</h2>
        <p>By placing bets across our opportunities, you can win real money in a matter of weeks. Below you can see the returns based on different win rates, assuming bets are made at -110:</p>
