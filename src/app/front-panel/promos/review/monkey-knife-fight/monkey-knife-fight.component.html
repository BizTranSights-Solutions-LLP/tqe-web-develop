        <p>With the implementation of PASPA, a law that legalized sports betting in the US, hybrid DFS-player prop parlay sites, such as Monkey Knife Fight, have sprung to life.</p>
        <p><b>What is Monkey Knife Fight?</b></p>
        <p>Disregarding the Simpsons reference, <a href="https://www.monkeyknifefight.com/newgame?p_source=affiliate&amp;p_affiliate=TQE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monkey Knife Fight</a> is a fun new site that offers everything from daily fantasy player props to over/under player parlays. Their payouts differ from 1.57x your wager all the way up to 19x your wager, depending on the size of the parlay. There are also parlay off-shoots where you only need to hit three of the four or four of the five player predictions. Once the game starts, your bet is locked in and because of the potentially high payouts, this creates quite the sweat.</p>
        <p><b>User Interface and Software</b></p>
        <p>Monkey Knife Fight has a clean UI and a mobile friendly site. The website is fast on both desktop and mobile and very easy to navigate, making your sports betting experience about as much fun as possible. Monkey Knife Fight knows it has a fun name and plays up to it with some of their home page graphics, including Roger Goodell on a stripper pole.</p>

        <p><b>Sports</b></p>
        <p>Monkey Knife Fight offers contests for NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, Soccer, and Golf.</p>
        <p><b>Contests</b></p>
        <p>Contests include Stat Shootout, Rapid Fire, and Over/Under.</p>
        <p><i>Stat Fire</i>: Choose a list of players and a stat goal for those players to exceed. For example, in order to cash in the NBA “Scoring Champ,” you pick any three players in that particular game that will score more points than the line provided. Monkey Knife Fight provides three lines: one where you can 2x, 3x, or 5x your money. The higher the payout, the higher the line.</p>
        <p><i>Rapid Fire</i>: Depending on the size of the payout, select a team by choosing the highest scoring player in multiple head-to-head matchups and statistical categories. Some players are offered a handicap, which will be seen in green to the right of the players name with a + and whatever the handicap number is. Depending on the amount of players selected, you have the opportunity to 1.68x your money all the way up to 19x your money.</p>
        <p><i>Over/Under</i>: This contest is the most straightforward. Simply choose your team of two to five players and select the over or under you prefer for the given statistical category. Payouts range from 1.58x to 19x your money.</p>
        <p><b>Banking</b></p>
        <p>You can deposit to Monkey Knife Fight using your credit or debit card. You can withdraw your winnings via PayPal or check.</p>
        <p><b>Deposit Bonus</b></p>
        <p>Monkey Knife Fight advertises that they have 100% instant deposit match up to $50 or $100, depending which screen loads. When depositing personally, I’ve only seen the $50 instant deposit match. To their credit, I received my bonus immediately into my account and was able to wager as much of my deposit as preferred.</p>
        <p><b>Monkey Knife Fight Review</b></p>
        <p>Simply put, the best way to describe Monkey Knife Fight is; it’s a lot of fun. The site works great on multiple platforms and the vast contest types and payouts offer a ton of different over/under player props and parlays. While the long-shot 19x payout wagers are always risky, I have not encountered a site that offers realistic long-shots such as Monkey Knife Fight. One critique I have is the inability to wager the under on “Stat Fire” contest, as most of the lines are high, which makes it the least popular contest to play. Overall, I’m a fan and highly recommend Monkey Knife Fight; they offer a ton of fun and strong payouts to this new DFS – player prop bet – parlay gaming sector and allows for a fun “sweat” while watching your favorite team(s) play.</p>
