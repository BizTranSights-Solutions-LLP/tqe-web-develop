        </ul>
        <p><b>Best Odds</b> – At Caesars, you’ll find the industry standard of -110. Money lines are nicely juiced, and they provide fair, industry standard lines. Interestingly. Caesars offers fewer options than competing sportsbooks, lacking in player props and daily odds boosts. They do, however, have plenty of casino game options to make the site lively and interesting.</p>
        <p><b>Deposit Options</b> – There are numerous safe and secure deposit options to add funds to your real-money gaming account, including credit cards, bank transfers, and PayPal.</p>
        <p><b>Mobile App</b> – We look forward to seeing it evolve and improve in the future; Caesars is actively working to continue improving the user experience</p>
        <p><b>Easy Withdrawal</b> – Getting your money is easy with a full range of quick withdrawal options and headache free</p>
        <p><b>Customer Service </b>– Caesars prides itself in offering excellent customer service; you can email, call, live chat, and they have customer service agents available 24 hours a day, seven days a week</p>
        <p><b>Daily Odds Boost</b> – Caesars does not offer daily odds boosts</p>
        <p><b>Look and Feel</b> – Clean, simple easy-to-understand layout; while it may not provide as many options for how to bet a game, it may be the most user-friendly site for a first-time sports bettor</p>
        <p><b>Deposit Bonus</b> – A free sports bet of up to $300 in an excellent deposit bonus. Make sure you are clear that the amount of your initial wager determines the value of your matching free bet. Therefore, if you deposit $300 and your first bet is only $100, your free bet will be $100. Also, a free bet can’t be divided up into smaller pieces, and it is a one-time bet for the full value.</p>
        <p><b>Promotions and Bonuses </b>– Caesars offers a total rewards program to convert rewards points into free plays and free stays and perks at nearly 40 Caesars Rewards resorts and casinos. It is among their most highly promoted features and is among the better-devised and more comprehensive programs in the industry.</p>
