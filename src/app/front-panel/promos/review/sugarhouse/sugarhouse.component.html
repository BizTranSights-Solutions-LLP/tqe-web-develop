        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Sports Betting &amp; Online Casino Games | Sugarhouse</h2>
        <p>Sugarhouse offers a sportsbook for sports betting, and online casino games all operated under the gaming license of the Golden Nugget Casino. For betting on sports, Sugarhouse provides a wide array of wagering options, and it also has a broad offering of casino games to play online. A mobile app is available, that is user-friendly and gives you access to games when you’re away from your main screen. There are aspects of Sugarhouse which earn high ratings among online gambling sites, and others we feel might be cleaner and more concise in the way they are presented. Many bettors like the site, and it deserves a close look.</p>

        <p><b>Best Odds</b> – Sugarhouse offers the industry standard of -110, but often moves juice from -110 to -112 and -109 instead of the regular -115 and -105. Money lines are juiced fairly, and Sugarhouse offers fair, industry standard lines.</p>
        <p><b>Deposit Options</b> – Sugarhouse offers numerous deposit options, including credit cards, bank transfers, and PayPal.</p>
        <p><b>Mobile Betting App</b> – The Sugarhouse mobile betting app has its upsides and downsides. For casino games, it is as good as it gets. Every game is mobile friendly and easy to use. On the sports betting side, a lot is going on, and it is easy to become lost when trying to place your wagers.</p>
        <p><b>Easy Withdrawals</b> – Sugarhouse offers fast withdrawal options. You can directly deposit into your account or Neteller. While Sugarhouse currently accepts PayPal for payment, you cannot withdraw via PayPal. Withdrawals can be completed in seconds, and the money will be in your account within 24 hours.</p>
        <p><b>Customer Service </b>– Compared to some betting sites, you’ll find excellent customer service with Sugarhouse online casino. You can email, call, live chat, and they have people available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
        <p><b>Daily Odds Boost</b> – Every day, Sugarhouse has a dedicated section of its website and mobile wagering app for daily odds boost. They have boosts to lines, player props, and parlays. Unfortunately, they do not let you know about the odds before the boost. They do, however, have push notifications on your app and will alert you to the most significant odds boosts throughout the day, so you don’t miss out on excellent value opportunities.</p>
        <p><b>Look and Feel</b> – While the casino side of the website is well done, the sportsbook is overwhelming. Sugarhouse does not abide by the less is more theory, and we feel it can be challenging to figure out where you want to go.</p>
        <p><b>Deposit Bonus</b> – 100% deposit bonus up to $250 is an excellent value, maybe the best in the entire industry. You may encounter error messages saying the deposit code does not work the first two times you try, but if you input it again at the final stages, it will work. The notification your promo code doesn’t work pops up on each use of the app for some users. While it can be a frustrating process, the value is undeniable.</p>
        <p><b>Free Plays</b> – Sugarhouse will offer free online sports bets around the time of marquee sporting events or launches of new products. They also have a customer rewards area, and the more you wager, the more points rack up — which can lead to free bets.</p>
        <p><b>Promotions and Bonuses </b>– As an addition to a deposit bonus and free plays, Sugarhouse offers you cash for every friend you refer. They also will provide you with reload bonuses if you go a while without being active on their betting website.</p>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>Sugarhouse Review Summary from The Quant Edge</b></h4>
        <p>Sugarhouse has a couple of noticeable flaws in the form of its overwhelming sports betting layout and the possible error notifications when claiming a bonus, despite that fact it will work ultimately, and you will be credited. They do offer smooth transactions and a wide array of betting options for NFL, NBA, MLB, and more on top of significant variations of casino games. Sugarhouse certainly deserves to be included when you are signing up for multiple sportsbooks.</p>
